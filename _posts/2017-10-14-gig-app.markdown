GIG is an app for going to concerts with your friends. 

**RESEARCH**

**Original Problem Statement:** People who attend many concerts have a disjointed experience purchasing, organizing and attending multiple events.

After deciding on what I thought the problem was, I looked at what already exists in the market to solve this problem. I looked at products that help people plan for events and products that allow you to buy tickets to an event, specifically concerts.

My main competitors, it seems, are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ticketfly.com/">Ticketfly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://news.bandsintown.com/home">Bands In Town</a>. But, neither one of them fully did what I wanted it to do: planning for the show and buying tickets. 

Next, I developed a target audience and interviewed people in that audience. My target audience is anyone who goes to a lot of concerts. Although this could be any age, this usually applies to a younger, 20s audience because, after interviewing someone in their 30s, it seems anyone older didn't have as much free time to go to tons of shows.

From this research I decided on the users goals, problems and a new problem statement. Although I didn't structure the user interviews around their friends, every person interviewed brought up their friends when asked about their concert-going experience. 

**Goals:**
* Interviewees wanted to be able to find and attend concerts easily
* All interviewees considered their friendsâ€™ interest when attending shows

**Problems:**
* Knowing about all the concerts available in their area
* Knowing which friends are interested in certain concerts
* Planning for event

**New Problem Statement:** People who attend many concerts have trouble accessing the information they need about the shows in their area and planning for the event with their friends.
