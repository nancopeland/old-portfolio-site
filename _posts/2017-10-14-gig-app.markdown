GIG is an app for going to concerts with your friends.

**RESEARCH**

**Original Problem Statement:** People who attend many concerts have a disjointed experience purchasing, organizing and attending multiple events.

After deciding on what I thought the problem was, I looked at what already exists in the market to solve this problem. I looked at products that help people plan for events and products that allow you to buy tickets to an event, specifically concerts.

My main competitors, it seems, are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ticketfly.com/">Ticketfly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://news.bandsintown.com/home">Bands In Town</a>. But, neither one of them fully did what I wanted it to do: planning for the show and buying tickets. 

Next, I developed a target audience and interviewed people in that audience. My target audience is anyone who goes to a lot of concerts. Although this could be any age, this usually applies to a younger, 20s audience because, after interviewing someone in their 30s, it seems anyone older didn't have as much free time to go to tons of shows.

From this research I decided on the users goals, problems and a new problem statement. Although I didn't structure the user interviews around their friends, every person interviewed brought up their friends when asked about their concert-going experience. 

**Goals:**
* Interviewees wanted to be able to find and attend concerts easily
* All interviewees considered their friendsâ€™ interest when attending shows

**Problems:**
* Knowing about all the concerts available in their area
* Knowing which friends are interested in certain concerts
* Planning for event

**New Problem Statement:** People who attend many concerts have trouble accessing the information they need about the shows in their area and planning for the event with their friends.

**PLANNING**

The next step was deciding which features the solution should have. I decided on an app instead of a website because of convenience and the target audience. I also had this idea to incorporate Venmo which would require my solution to be an app.

Then, I moved on to sketching and wireframing. I talked to a few people about the information architecture of the site and they all grouped "shows you're attending" with "shows you're friends are attending." This was probably the most difficult thing to visualize because there were so many ways to show it.
