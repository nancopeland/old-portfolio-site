I updated the Slate podcasts process to make it easier for users to explore Slate's shows, find what they're looking for and subscribe. The design was updated to fit the [new Slate brand launched in 2018](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html){:target="_blank"}.

**Background**

The podcast redesign process followed [Slate's site redesign](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/why-we-redesigned-slate.html){:target="_blank"} where Slate updated their [design process](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html){:target="_blank"} and [CMS](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/slates-new-cms.html){:target="_blank"}. Slate's articles were prioritized during this process so when I started as a designer, podcast publishing was still done using the old CMS.

This page functioned like a tag page so it only featured the latest podcast episodes in reverse chronological order. This wasn't the best way to for a user to find a certain show or episode nor did it allow for much exploration. 

**Planning**

Product Manager [Chris Schieffer](https://twitter.com/cschieffer){:target="_blank"} conducted extensive interviews with various Slate people to see what they wanted out of the new podcast pages. He decided there would be three pages and came up with the following priorities for each page:
