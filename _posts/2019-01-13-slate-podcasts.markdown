I updated the Slate podcasts process to make it easier for users to explore Slate's shows, find what they're looking for and subscribe. The design was updated to fit the [new Slate brand launched in 2018](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html){:target="_blank"}.

**Background**

The podcast redesign process followed [Slate's site redesign](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/why-we-redesigned-slate.html){:target="_blank"} where Slate updated their [design process](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html){:target="_blank"} and [CMS](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/slates-new-cms.html){:target="_blank"}. Slate's articles were prioritized during this process so when I started as a designer, the podcasts were still in the old's CMS.

This page functioned like a tag page so it only featured the latest podcast episodes in reverse chronological order. This wasn't the best way to for a user to find a certain show or episode nor did it allow for much exploration.
