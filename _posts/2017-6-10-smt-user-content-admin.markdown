I am currently working on improving the CMS for **[Social Media Today](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/)**. Because the site runs on user-generated content (ie. anyone can make an account and submit a story), the submission and approval process is crucial.

**History**

Industry Dive acquired Social Media Today (SMT) in 2015 and for the first year, we were just maintaining the site and keeping the content updated. Recently, we decided to convert this site so it is on the same platform as our other publications. 

Part of that conversion is moving the site onto our custom CMS. But, because SMT runs off of user-submitted content (not reviewed by in-house editors like our other publications), there are a few extra functionalities that needed to be added, such as content submission and approval. 

The goal is that these mockups will eventually lead to a redesign of our custom CMS. 

**Process**

First, I interviewed many of the people who worked on the site: writers submitting content, editors and admins approving content, ad operations managers trying to place ads and general users of the site. Their main issue with the CMS was that it was clunky and not intuitive:

**1. Filtering user-submitted content:** no clear indication of which posts are drafts, submitted for review and approved to publish

**2. How users submit content:** language on page isn't clear, no clear difference between drafts and submitted content, hard to preview story

**3. How editors/admins submit content:** hard to find page where you would add content, selecting images and tags is tedious, hard to schedule posts

Users are either regular users (they can only write and submit stories) or admin users (they can write and submit content as well as approve and publish content). Throughout the interviews, admin users expressed interest in a more rigorous application process to become a contributor due to the number of stagnant users and bots.

After interviewing, I looked at a variety of content management systems, specifically [Vox Media's Chorus](https://product.voxmedia.com/2016/2/23/11098476/curbed-on-chorus-the-start-of-a-new-era-at-vox-media), and also sites used for storage and document organization, such as Google Drive and Dropbox. These provided not only design inspiration but also ideas for navigation and functionality. 

According to the interviews, my overall goal was to unify the CMS dashboard (previously was hosted on Drupal) and the MySMT page to improve navigation ease and make each process easier to find.

Because of all the user confusion, I added more notifications that will make the site clearer for both regular and new users.

For an admin or editor who is approving and publishing content, I wanted to make it super easy to find the newly submitted posts from users. This content should be separate from what is already published on the site.

The "New Post" page where all users would submit content is still being designed. I hope to make it WYSIWYG. Stay tuned for updates on this project!
