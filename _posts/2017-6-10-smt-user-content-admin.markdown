I am currently working on improving the CMS for **[Social Media Today](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/)**. Because the site runs on user-generated content (ie. anyone can make an account and submit a story), the submission and approval process is crucial.

First, I interviewed many of the people who worked on the site: writers submitting content, editors approving content, ad operations managers trying to place ads and general users of the site. Their main issue with the CMS is that it is clunky and not intuitive:

**1. Filtering user-submitted content:** no clear indication of which posts are drafts, submitted for review and approved to publish. 

**2. How users submit content:** language on page isn't clear, no clear difference between drafts and submitted content, hard to preview story

**3. How admins submit content:** hard to find page where you would add content, selecting images and tags is tedious, hard to schedule posts

After interviewing, I looked at a variety of content management systems, specifically [Vox Media's Chorus](https://product.voxmedia.com/2016/2/23/11098476/curbed-on-chorus-the-start-of-a-new-era-at-vox-media), and also sites used for storage and document organization, such as Google Drive and Dropbox. These provided not only design inspiration but also ideas for navigation and functionality. 

According to the interviews, the Social Media Today CMS's navigation definitly needed to be improved. The new navigation has two places to navigate the website and uses consistent language.

I also think clear notifications would help make the site clearer for both regular and new users.

For an admin user who is approving and publishing content, I wanted to make it super easy to find the newly submitted posts from users. This content should be separte from what is already published on the site.

The "New Post" page where all users would submit content is still being designed. I hope to make it WYSIWYG. Stay tuned for updates on this project!
