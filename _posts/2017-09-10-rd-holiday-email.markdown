I recently designed and coded a custom email template for a special **[Retail Dive: Holiday Edition newsletter](http://link.retaildive.com/view/557740847cfe31366b8b49ae69lmm.hen/d22a6b15)**. The email is going to have similar content to the daily newsletter but with a lighter, funnier tone so the design needed to reflect that.

<div class="row">
	<span class="help-text">Gmail (desktop):</span>
	<div class="columns">
		<img class="p-img" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/rd_holiday_email/gmail_desktop.jpg" style="margin:0 0 4rem 0;">
	</div>
</div>

**Project Assignment**

This project was initially requested by the Audience Development team but it also involved input from the Sales and Editorial teams. The Audience team said this newsletter was going to be similar to the daily newsletter but with a lighter tone and was going to be holiday-themed so the design needed to reflect these changes. 

design > what you see when you open the email, testing/clients
