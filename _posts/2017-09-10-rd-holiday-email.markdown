I recently designed and coded a custom email template for a special **[Retail Dive: Holiday Edition newsletter](http://link.retaildive.com/view/557740847cfe31366b8b49ae69lmm.hen/d22a6b15)**. The email is going to have similar content to the daily newsletter but with a lighter, funnier tone so the design needed to reflect that.

<div class="row">
	<span class="help-text">Gmail (desktop):</span>
	<div class="columns">
		<img class="p-img" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/rd_holiday_email/gmail_desktop.jpg" style="margin:0 0 4rem 0;">
	</div>
</div>

**Project Assignment**

This project was initially requested by the Audience Development team but it also involved input from the Sales and Editorial teams. The Audience team said this newsletter was going to be similar to the daily newsletter but only sent out weekly with a lighter tone. As previously stated, it is holiday-themed so the design needed to reflect this. 

**Design**

For the design, I wanted to create a simple banner that had the "Retail Dive" logo, "Holiday Edition" and some sort of holiday element. The most important thing was that the image was short so the user could see the intro when the email was opened. It was also important that the user could see the sponsor when they opened the email.

The email was tested extensively and although the design is pretty simple, there were definitely some bugs that had to be addressed. It should look good in all major desktop and mobile cleints. 

<div class="row">
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<span class="help-text">Gmail (app):</span>
		<img class="p-img" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/rd_holiday_email/gmail_app.jpg" style="margin:0 0 4rem 0;">
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<span class="help-text">Apple Mail (app):</span>
		<img class="p-img" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/rd_holiday_email/apple_mail_app.jpg" style="margin:0 0 4rem 0;">
	</div>
</div> 

<video width="325" controls autoplay loop style="display: block; margin:0 auto 3rem auto;">
  	<source src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/rd_holiday_email/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

**Open Rates**

So far the email has performed pretty well with solid open and click-through rates. The Audience team and I are making small improvements each week to increase clicks and engagement.
