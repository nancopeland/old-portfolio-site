<h3>News Page</h3>

**Problem:** The news/blog posts on Industry Dive's corporate site were tagged with different topics but there was no way to filter the posts with said topics.  

**Solution:** Use a `<select>` dropdown that visualizes filtering the posts. I used [Ted's talks page](http://www.ted.com/talks) for inspiration.
