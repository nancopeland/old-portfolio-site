In addition to maintaining Industry Dive's publication sites, I also update our corporate site with small tools to make it easier to use. Here are a few of those updates. 

<h2>News Page</h2>

**Problem:** The news/blog page were tagged with different topics but there was no way to filter the posts with said topics.  

**Solution:** Use a `<select>` dropdown that visualizes filtering the posts. I used [Ted's talks page](http://www.ted.com/talks) for inspiration.

<h2>Team Page</h2>
