I am currently working on improving the CMS for Social Media Today. Because the site runs on user-generated content (ie. anyone can make an account and submit a story), the submission and approval process is crucial. 

First, I interviewed many of the people who worked on the site: writers submitting content, editors approving content, ad operations managers trying to place ads and general users of the site.
