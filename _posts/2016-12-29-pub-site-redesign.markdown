Industry Dive has 12 publications each focusing on a different industry. Although their main product is a daily newsletter for each publication, the publication sites (which the newsletters link to) needed to be updated. 

**Problem:** Site looks outdated and clunky. User experience could also be improved overall to increase engagement and ad clicks.

**Solution:** Update design and utilize user feedback update site's design. This solution includes a variety of design updates but we focused on keeping the design clean and easy to understand for users of all ages and technical literacies. 

**Overall goals:** 
1. Improve **overall aesthetic.** 
- improve visual hierarchy
- utilize negative space 
- use less images

7. Improve **content discoverability/navigation**

One part of the site I worked on was the menu. With the menu, my goals were to anchor the page, hide minimal content (I can't argue with [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/what-you-see-is-what-you-use-5a97677a8c71#.18bilnmdf)) and block off the top ad while still making it appealing to click on.
