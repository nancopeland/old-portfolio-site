Industry Dive has 12 publications each focusing on a different industry. Although their main product is a daily newsletter for each publication, the publication sites (which the newsletters link to) needed to be updated. 

**Problem:** Site looks outdated and clunky. User experience could also be improved overall to increase engagement and ad clicks.

**Solution:** Update design and utilize user feedback update site's design. This solution includes a variety of design updates but we focused on keeping the design clean and easy to understand for users of all ages and technical literacies. 

**Some overall goals:** 

**1. Improve overall aesthetic.** 
- improve visual hierarchy
- utilize negative space 
- use less images

![new site article]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_new_article.gif){:width='700px'}
![new site jobs]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_new_jobs.jpg)

**2. Significantly improve mobile experience for readers.**
- ease navigation friction
- call out topics more explicitly 
![navigation]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_navigation.gif){:width='300px'}
![navigation topics]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_navigation_topics.gif){:width='300px'}

**3. Improve ad units**
- no sticky ads, create responsive ad spot
- make ads more native, but not deceiving, to increase clicks

![native ad mobile]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_ad_mobile.jpg){:width='300px'}

**4. Improve content discoverability/navigation**
- reduce navigation clicks
- call out navigation content explicitly
- improve navigating site with via topics

This is the part of the site I worked on heavily. With the menu navigation, my goals were to anchor the page, hide minimal content (I can't argue with [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/what-you-see-is-what-you-use-5a97677a8c71#.18bilnmdf)) and block off the top ad while still making it appealing to click on.
