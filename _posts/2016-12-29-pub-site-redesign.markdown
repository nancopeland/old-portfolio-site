I was part of the team who redesigned Industry Dive's [13 publication sites](http://industrydive.com/industries/). Each site focuses on a different industry and although the main product is a daily newsletter for each publication, the publication sites (which the newsletters link to) needed to be updated.

**Problem:** Site looked outdated and clunky. User experience could also be improved to increase engagement and ad clicks.

**Solution:** Utilize user feedback to update site's design. This solution included a variety of design updates but we focused on keeping the design clean and easy to understand for users of all ages and technical literacies. 

**Overall goals:** 

**1. Improve overall aesthetic.** 
- improve visual hierarchy
- utilize negative space 
- use less images

**2. Significantly improve mobile experience for readers.**
- ease navigation friction
- call out topics more explicitly

![navigation topics]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_navigation_topics.gif){:width='300px'}

**3. Improve ad units**
- no sticky ads, create responsive ad spot
- make ads more native, but not deceiving, to increase clicks

![native ad mobile]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pub_sites/pub_site_ad_mobile.jpg){:width='300px'}

**4. Improve content discoverability/navigation**

- reduce navigation clicks
- call out navigation content explicitly
- improve navigating site with via topics

This is the part of the site I worked on heavily. With the menu navigation, my goals were to anchor the page, hide minimal content (I can't argue with [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/what-you-see-is-what-you-use-5a97677a8c71#.18bilnmdf)) and block off the top ad while still making it appealing to click on.
